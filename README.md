## Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>
This project is written in Python 3. Hence, the code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

Additionally you should install the following packages to run this project:
* pandas
* numpy 
* matplotlib.pyplot
* tree from sklearn


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
For this project, I was interestested in using Titanic data from Kaggle to better understand what my chances are to survive a shipping accident:

Question 1: How old were the passengers of the titanic. How old was the oldest passenger?

Question 2: How about the passenger distribution by gender? Where more male or more female passenger on board?

Question 3: What is the most influencial factor if a passenger died or survived?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
I wrote a notebook to investigate the questions above. At the end I give suggestions based on my exploratory analysis.
The analysis is based on the Kaggle file:
titanic.csv - This file contains the test dataset from the Kaggle Titanic challenge.


## Results<a name="results"></a>
The main findings of the code can be found at my blog post. Due to privacy considerations I decided not to publish it.

The Titanic dataset belongs to Kaggle. You can find Licensing information and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).
